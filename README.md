# React + Vite

This is a random quote generator that fetchs quotes from popular Anime series. 

This project was made in React. 

The quote displays on a card and at the bottom of the display card it shows the user, the name of the character that said the randomized quote as well as the show that particular character is from. 

The display card also features a reload button that randomly generates a quote from a show if one chooses not to refresh the page.

Please do not spam the reload button or refresh too often. Although the API is free to use all API endpoints only come with a default rate limit of 5 requests per hour.
